# instructions
General: write my own compiler. The project will have loops, conditional statements, arithmetic and even functions. 

the compiler is designed to be very easy to parse (i.e., easy for a computer program to read and understand). It bears no resemblance to any real programming language. Details of the language are shown below. This language will evolve over the two projects (Phase A and Phase B).

Implemented and designed my own approach, including data structures, algorithms, structs/classes, functions, etc. 
Prohibited from using any code from standard C, standard C++, or any other 3 rd -party library. 
The exceptions to this rule are the functions printf, C++ new and delete. Everything else must be built from scratch.

The Blip Language, var, set, output and text commands: For Phase A, implement four language statements. Two of these (var and set) are for creating and assignment values to variables, and two of these (output and text) are for producing output (i.e., printing to the screen). A Blip program consists of zero or more statements. Each statement begins with a keyword (var, set, output or text).
